# DataConversion
In this example we will convert string to HEX and vice versa

In the Cyber security world one way to hide data when sending it from client to server and vice versa we do not want to send it as a simple text string for example:

hello world

when we use wireshark or any packet sniffer we will see it in plain text, game companies and online games would have an encryption or 2 onto their packet data then mask it to HEX
before sending that data out to client/server

in this example we will not use encryptions like the one in my example here in the repo, but instead we will mask a simple plain text to HEX before sending over the internet.
